                    Farsi For Windows 95 (Arabic Edition)
                                 Revision 4
                            A MAZ software product
                                 1376/02/18

introduction:
        Arabic edition of Microsoft Windows 95 has the capability
        of writing farsi text itself. The only thing I did is to
        define a farsi keyboard. Now you can write farsi in all
        programs that use True Type fonts shipped with this version
        of windows. I have tested programs like Microsoft Word, Access
        and Excel (Arabic Editions for Windows 95) and everything is OK.
        Also, a FON file prepared for use in Hyper Terminal to view
        Farsi BBS systems compatible with IranSystem characters.
        Finally I've found a way to create farsi TrueType fonts, for
        Windows 95. Two sample TTF and a demo of others is included.
        Note that these TTF files are designed and tested for Windows 95
        specific application only.

History:
        Revision 1; Farsi KBD file only.
        Revision 2; Final nonisolated YA is assigned to Shift+D
                    A FON file created to use Farsi BBS systems.
        Revision 3; Now, FON file for farsi BBS systems is more readable
                    Two farsi TrueType fonts is included.
        Revision 4; HAMZEH is assigned to Shift+R
                    TrueType are now optimized (smaller & faster).

Keyboard Installation:
        Shut Down your windows 95 and in MS-DOS, Copy and overwrite
        the file KBDA1.KBD to windows/system folder.
        then start your windows and type farsi in Write Pad or Word.

HyperTerm Font Installation:
        Go to Fonts Folder and from File menu choose Install new font.
        Then specify FON file shipped with this package.
        In Hyper Terminal, choose View menu and Font Option, then
        in font list box, choose MS LineDraw Mazar.
        Now you can call Farsi BBS systems compatible with IranSystem.

TrueType Font Installation:
        In control panel, double click on fonts icon.
        Choose "Install new font" from file menu, then specify the
        location of TrueType (TTF) font files.
        These TTF files are Plug & Play and no other files required.
        
Exceptions:
        Screen fonts need some alterations. You can not type correct
        farsi strings in places like file names, folder names, and
        so on. I'm working on this problem and the solution will be
        available soon.
        TrueType fonts only work in applications which are designed
        specially for Windows 95.

More True Type Fonts:
        More True Type fonts are available in TADAROKE NARMAFZAR Co.
        for more information call 6460303. See file DEMO.GIF for
        other type faces available.

Distribution:
        Please distribute these files;

          BUT DON'T CHANGE THE CONTENTS AND NUMBER OF THESE FILES.
          AND DON'T DISTRIBUTE THE TTF FILES CALLED 'MAZAR' WHICH
